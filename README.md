# Introducting Volt

# NOTE:

#### I have moved the main development to a private repository, and as such will
#### be adding to this in chunks rather than allowing the state to change so often.
#### Stay tuned :) 3/21/15


Hi. You're a developer, or someone interested in writing some code. A web app even! This is fun. Awesome.
We're going to learn about Volt today. Volt is a web framework that allows us to write applications in which
the client and server are in a single language and we can easily bind things to be reactive between the two. Reactivity! Woo! It is also powered by [Opal](link) so that all of our code can be in Ruby, client and server both!
