# Introducting Volt

# NOTE:

#### This tutorial is currently working up through the end of part 3. Beyond this, the features that are being built upon require version 0.8.0's release which is soon, but has no officially announced date. Tag me in the Volt [gitter chat room](http://www.gitter.im/voltrb/volt)


Hi. You're a developer, or someone interested in writing some code. A web app even! This is fun. Awesome.
We're going to learn about Volt today. Volt is a web framework that allows us to write applications in which
the client and server are perfectly synced at all times. Reactivity! Woo! It is also powered by [Opal](link) so that all of our code can be in Ruby, client and server both!
