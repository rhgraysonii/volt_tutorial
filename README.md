# Introducting Volt

## Introduction
Hi. You're a developer, or someone interested in writing some code. A web app even! This is fun. Awesome.
We're going to learn about Volt today. Volt is a web framework that allows us to write applications in which
the client and server are perfectly synced at all times. Reactivity! Woo! It is also powered by [Opal](link) so that all of our code can be in Ruby, client and server both!
