module Opal
  module RSpec
    # {AsyncHelpers} is automatically included in all example groups to add
    # support for running specs async. Usually, rspec runners expect all
    # examples to run synchronously, but this is not ideal in the case for
    # Opal where a lot of underlying libraries expect the ability to run code
    # in an asynchronous manner.
    #
    # This module defines an {AsyncHelpers::ClassMethods.async} method which
    # can be used instead of `it` inside an example group, which marks the
    # example as being async. This makes the runner wait for the example to
    # complete.
    #
    #     describe "Some examples" do
    #       it "normal example" do
    #         # normal test code
    #       end
    #
    #       async "async example" do
    #         # this will wait until completion before moving on
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # Marking an example as being async is only half the task. Examples will
    # also have an instance {AsyncHelpers#async} method defined which is then
    # used to complete the example. Any code run inside this block will run
    # inside the context of the example.
    #
    #     describe "HTTP requests" do
    #       async "might take a while" do
    #         HTTP.get("/url/to/get") do |res|
    #           async { expect(res).to be_ok }
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # As soon as `async` is run inside the block, the example completes. This
    # means that only 1 `async` call is allowed. However, you can use `async`
    # multiple times aslong as it is only called once:
    #
    #     describe "HTTP requests" do
    #       async "should work" do
    #         HTTP.get("/users/1").then |res|
    #           async { expect(res).to be_ok }
    #         end.fail do
    #           async { raise "this should not be called" }
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # Here, a promise will either be accepted or rejected, so an `async` block
    # can be used in each case as only 1 will be called.
    #
    # Another helper, {AsyncHelpers#delay} can also be used to run a block of
    # code after a given time in seconds. This is useful to wait for animations
    # or time restricted operations to occur.
    module AsyncHelpers
      module ClassMethods
        # Define an async example method. This should be used instead of `it`
        # to inform the spec runner that the example will need to wait for an
        # {AsyncHelpers#async} method to complete the test. Any additional
        # configuration options can be passed to this call, and they just get
        # delegated to the underlying `#it` call.
        #
        # @example
        #   describe "Some tests" do
        #     async "should be async" do
        #       # ... async code
        #     end
        #
        #     it "should work with normal tests" do
        #       expect(1).to eq(1)
        #     end
        #   end
        #
        # @param desc [String] description

      # this is not called inside the body then the spec runner will time out
      # or the error might give a false positive as it is not caught inside
      # the current example.

      #   describe "HTTP calls" do
      #     async "complete eventually" do
      #       HTTP.get("/some_url") do |response|

      # The `duaration` should be given in seconds, i.e. `1` means 1 second, or
