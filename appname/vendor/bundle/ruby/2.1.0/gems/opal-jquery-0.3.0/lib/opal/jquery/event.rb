# {Event} wraps native jQuery events into a ruby api. Instances of events
# can be accessed by {#to_n}.
#
# {Event} instances should not be created directly, as they are usually
# created by one of the dom event handlers in {Element}.
#
#     element.on :click do |event|
#       puts event
#     end
#
#     # => #<Event:0x0000000>
#
# ## Usage
#
# {Event} exposes a slightly different API than jQuery, as {Event} tries to
# add some more ruby flavour to the object.
#
# ### Accessing element triggering event
#
# Unlike jQuery, the context of an event handler is not set to the triggering
# element. Instead, the element triggering the event can be accessed from the
# {Event} instance.
#
# #### Current Target
#
# To access the current element in the bubbling phase, {#element} or
# {#current_target} can be used which is the same as `currentTarget` or `this`
# from jQuery.
#
#     element.on :click do |event|
#       puts "element clicked: #{event.element}
#     end
#
#     # => "element clicked: #<Element: [<div>]>
#
# #### Target
#
# The {#target} of an event is the actual dom element that triggered the event,
# and this will be the same element through all phases of event bubbling. This
# is the same as the `event.target` jQuery property.
#
#     element.on :click do |event|
#       puts "actual element: #{event.target}"
#     end
#
#     # => "actual element: #<Element: [<div>]>
#
# ### Controlling Event Bubbling
#
# Propagation and default behaviour can be controlled on events using {#prevent}
# and {#stop}, which will prevent the browser default and stop event propagation
# respectively.
#
#     element.on :click do |event|
#       event.prevent   # prevent browser default
#       event.stop      # stop event propagation
#     end
#
# If you want to trigger both methods, which is usually the case, then {#kill}
# can be used as a shorthand.
#
#     element.on :click do |event|
#       event.kill
#       puts event.prevented?
#       puts event.stopped?
#     end
#
#     # => true
#     # => true
